## About Me!
I am a freshman in college, and this is my first time doing anything with computer science.
I am 18 years old and currently live in Star, Idaho.
I commute to school on the days I have classes.
Some of my hobbies are that I like to water ski, and I love doing outdoor physical activities. 
I also really enjoy watching football!
My favorite team is the LA Chargers.
